## featuressss

- node.js + express  
- ejs templating  
- body-parser cuz thatâ€™s what cool kids do  
- no database (cuz commitment is scary)

1. clone the repo  
2. run `npm install`  
3. start with `node index.js` or keep it fancy with `nodemon index.js`  
4. open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
