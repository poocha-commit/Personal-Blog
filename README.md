# Personal-Blog
caution: retina risk


this is a blog web app i made where you can write stuff,read stuff,and delete stuff if you suddenly hate it.classic.  
no(forgot) database,just vibes (and a js array).


featuressss
-node.js+express
-ejs templating
-body-parser cuz thats what cool kids do
-no database(cuz commitment is scary)


#how to run??
clone the repo
'npm install'
node index.js or nodemon index.js(keep it fancy bro)
open "localhost:3000"

why???
because i need a place to yell, and the colors make up for the inefficiency okay?
